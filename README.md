# Introduction

A simple and easy-to-use personal static website template for beginners.

Disclaimer: This project is only for beginners who want to build a website quickly:)

# FRATURES

Use vue2 + element for better development and beautification.

Use simple ways to import vue2 and element instead of using vue-cli or vite because that can be a bit difficult for beginners.

# HOW to use it

- Download the code.
- Put all the files into your project's folder.
- Open any editor and get started.

## Where to write the code

Write HTML code, CSS code, JS code, and so on in the appropriate places just like you would a web page

"index.html" is the entry point to the website and I've prepared an example web page.

Since I import vue2 and element, you can use it as much as you like in your code.

You can create other pages and import them in the same way as an instance page.

## What folders do

Theoretically you can put the resource files anywhere, but I recommend that you put them in the appropriate folders, which keeps the project tidy.

assets: the place where resource files are stored

lib: the place where dependent files are stored

pages: the place where other pages are stored.

# How do I deploy my website and get it live

There are a lot of tools you can use to deploy your website

Take NGINX as an example, you only need to put all the files into the HTML folder, and start NGINX to launch the website on the corresponding host, and then access it according to the host IP and port (if set).
